# Advanced-Statistics-for-Management
Statistics has been evolving rapidly to keep up with the modern world. I did this work as part of my course STAT 571 (cross listed as 
STAT 701 for MBA's) at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. It starts with ways to modify and adapt simpler models; then goes
beyond with relatively newer methods/techniques to handle contemporary large and complex data with applications in finance, marketing,
medical fields, social science, entertaining, etc. 

A brief short list of methods include: 
Multiple Regression/Stepwise Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN (K nearest neighbor), LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), 
QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis), LASSO, Ridge Regression, PCA, Tree based methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines. 
Some text mining methods was introduced.  Bootstrap and k-fold cross validation will be used and criterions such as Training and
Testing errors, ROC/AUC and FDR are used. The free but powerful software “R” was used for coding.
